# Ruud's Home Automation System
Ruud's Home Automation System (short RHAS) is meant to run on my raspberry PI and uses my Homewizard (check http://www.homewizard.nl) to read sensordata. In the future it should function as some sort of home automation hub in my house.

## Why bother us with it?
Because I try to build it as general as possible, so other people can use it for their own purposes

## Configuration
Download the source. Create config.inc.php from the example and you can go.
N.B. At this moment the frontpage shows a map of my house. I have a plan to build this some sort of general so you can use your own map.

## Current status
At this point RHAS uses the Homewizard to thermometer data and put it on the frontpage. In the future it will be far more than that
